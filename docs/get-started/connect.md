# Connect Your Github Account

To use Changeset, you'll need to [login](https://changeset.io/login) using your source control provider. We currently only support [Github](https://github.com), but other providers will be supported soon.

Changeset stores the following account information from your source control provider

- `email` Changeset only sends transactional emails for things like billing and important account information
- `username` Changeset may display the username you have chosen to use with your source control provider when contacting you
